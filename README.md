What is Programming ? <br>
It is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

What is OOP ?<br>
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.

What is Difference between Interpreter and Compiler ?<br>
Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code line by line while Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.

What are Header Files ? <br>
Header files are the collection of predefined classes and functions.

What is Block in a program ?<br>
A block is a set of logically connected statements that are surrounded by opening and closing braces.

What is Identifier ?<br>
Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item.

What is Variable ?<br>
A variable is a name which is associated with a value that can be changed.

What are Operators ?<br>
Operators are used to perform operations on values referred by variables.

What are constants ?<br>
Constants are name given to variables that can't be modified once initialized.

What is Precedence in OOP?<br>
Precedence denotes the order in which an operator perform the operation. 

What is Associativity in OOP?<br>
When operators have same precedence, then associativity will determine the order of execution.

What is Array ?<br>
is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

What is Constructor ?<br>
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.<br>

In Java, constructors can be divided into 3 types:<br>

No-Arg Constructor<br>
Parameterized Constructor<br>
Default Constructor


What is Function ?<br>
A function is a block of code, are used to perform certain task.

What is Function Overloading ?<br>
Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters.

What is TyeConversion ?<br>
Conversion of data from one type to another is called TypeConversion.

What is Naming Conventions ?<br>
Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.

What is Aggregation ?<br>
If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation.

What is Recursion in JAVA ?<br>
Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.

What is Call by value in JAVA?<br>
If we call a method passing a value, it is known as call by value.

What is Exception Handling ?<br>
Exception handling is used to change the normal flow of the code execution if a specified error (exceptional) condition occurs. This condition is called an exception. 


What is Method Overloading ? 
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.<br>

What is Method Overriding ?
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

What is Object ?<br>
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc.

What is Class ?<br>
Class is a Blueprint, which holds it's own data members and members function.
Class is a group of similar objects.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, where hypertext is the ability to turn a piece of text into a hyperlink that HTML makes it so that viewer can visit any document.

What is CSS Box Modal ? <br>
CSS Box Modal is essentialy a box that wraps around every HTML element. Each feature that is displayed on the webpage is shown as a rectangular box. 


What is meant by MVC Architecture ? <br>
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

What is Next.js ?<br>
Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It includes styling and routing solutions out of the box, and assumes that you’re using Node.js as the server environment.

What is Long Polling ? <br>
Long Polling is a web development pattern that is used to surpass pushing data from the server to the client. By using Long Polling pattern, the Client requests information from the server. If the server does not have any information about the client, the server holds the request and waits for some information to be available rather than sending an empty resource.


What is CORS ? <br>
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a process used to gain the authority of different web resources on different domains. With the help of CORS, the integration of web scripts can be implemented more freely with the external content of the original domain.

What is Multi Threading ? <br>
The process of improving the performance of the CPU is known as Multi-Threading. Usually, it is seen as the ability of a program to be managed by multiple users at a single time.

What is React JS ?<br>
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. 

What is Component ?
Component is a piece of reusable code which you can be reused at any point and it's an individual piece of code which has it's own inputs and it's own outputs and it has it's own functionaliy.

What is React Hooks ? <br>
Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

<br>

What is Junit ?<br>
JUnit is a unit testing open-source framework for the Java programming language. Java Developers use this framework to write and execute automated tests.<br>
<br>
What are the use cases of Junit Testing ?<br>
&rarr; To find bugs early in the development phase, which increases the code&rsquo;s reliability<br>
&rarr; Junit makes the code more readable, reliable, and bug-free<br>
&rarr; It boosts the confidence of the developer and motivates them immensely<br>
&rarr; Junit enables the developer to invest more time in reading the code than writing it<br>
<br>
Why is JAVA called an Object Oriented Programming language ?<br>
Java is purely an object oriented language due to the absence of global scope. Everything in java is an object, all the program codes and data resides within classes and objects.<br>
<br>

A repository in a git is the place where we store our software work. It contains a subdirectory called .git<br>

<br>
Multithreading advantages:<br>
Increased performance: Multithreading allows a program to make use of multiple CPU cores, which can significantly increase the program's performance, especially for CPU-intensive tasks.<br>
Improved responsiveness: Multithreading can improve the user experience by allowing a program to respond to user input while performing other tasks in the background.<br>
Resource sharing: Multiple threads can share resources such as memory and CPU time, which can lead to better resource utilization and lower resource consumption.<br>
Simplicity: Multithreading can simplify the programming model by allowing developers to write more straightforward, modular code that can be executed concurrently.<br>
Asynchronous processing: Multithreading allows for asynchronous processing, which means that a program can continue to perform tasks while waiting for input/output operations to complete.<br>
Scalability: Multithreading allows a program to scale its performance to meet the demands of larger workloads without requiring significant changes to the program's architecture.<br>

<br>
Context switching is a fundamental mechanism used by operating systems to share CPU time between multiple threads or processes.<br>

What is serialization<br>
Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream. For serializing the object, we call the writeObject() method of ObjectOutputStream class.<br>
<br>
What is deserialization?<br>
The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object. For deserializing the object, we call the readObject() method of ObjectInputStream class.<br>
<br>
What is transient keyword in serialization?<br>
The transient keyword can be used with the data members of a class in order to avoid their serialization.<br>
<br>
What is newInstance() method ?<br>
The newInstance() method of Class class and Constructor class is used to create a new instance of the class.<br>
<br>
what is serial version id?<br>
SerialVersionUID is a unique identifier for each class, JVM uses it to compare the versions of the class ensuring that the same class was used during Serialization is loaded during Deserialization. Specifying one gives more control, though JVM does generate one if you don't specify.<br>
<br>
What is externalization in java ?<br>
Externalization in Java is used whenever you need to customize the serialization mechanism. If a class implements an Externalizable interface, then serialization of the object will be done using the method writeExternal().<br>
<br>
what is reflection in java?<br>
Reflection in Java is an API(Application Programming Interface) that is used at runtime to analyze or change classes, methods, and interfaces. It is a process of examining or modifying the run time behavior of a class at run time.<br>
<br>
what is the difference between serialization and externalization ?<br>
serialization interface passes the responsibity of serialization to jvm and the programmer has no control over serialization while externalizable interface provides all serialization responsibilities to a programmer and hence jvm has no control over serialization.<br>
<br>
what is the difference betweeb serialization and synchronization ?<br>
serialization is a process of converting the state of an object into bytestream while synchronization is the process of capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.<br>
<br>
what is not serializable exception error?<br>
a NotSerializableException exception is thrown when an instance of a class does not implemented the Serializable interface. for the serialization class must implemented serializable interface.

what is comparable in java ?<br>
 Comparable is an interface which defines a way to compare an object with other objects of the same type. It has a single abstract method compareTo() that objects need to implement to have a natural ordering.
 
 what is comparator in java ?<br>
 Comparator is an functional interface used to compare two objects of the same type. It has a single abstract method called compare(). This method takes two parameters of the same type and returns an integer value that represents the result of the comparison.

Explain difference between comparable and comparator ? <a href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/comparable-in-java/#WhatiscomparatorinJava?:~:text=our%20next%20topic.-,Comparable%20v/s%20Comparator%20in%20Java,-Comparable%20in%20Java">click here</a>
