It is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.

What is OOP ?<br>
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.

What is Difference between Interpreter and Compiler ?<br>
Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code line by line while Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.

What are Header Files ? <br>
Header files are the collection of predefined classes and functions.

What is Block in a program ?<br>
A block is a set of logically connected statements that are surrounded by opening and closing braces.

What is Identifier ?<br>

What is Naming Conventions ?<br>
Java naming convention is a rule to follow as you decide what to name your identifiers such as class, package, variable, constant, method, etc.

What is Aggregation ?
If a class have an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation.

What is Exception Handling ?<br>
Exception handling is used to change the normal flow of the code execution if a specified error (exceptional) condition occurs. This condition is called an exception. 

What is Encapsulation ? <br>
Binding code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.

What is Inheritance ?<br>
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.

What is Polymorphism ?<br>
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to identify as more than one type. 

What is Abstraction ? <br>
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

What is Method Overloading ? 
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.<br>

What is Method Overriding ?
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

What is Object ?<br>
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc.

What is Class ?<br>

What is Next.js ?<br>
Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It includes styling and routing solutions out of the box, and assumes that you’re using Node.js as the server environment.

What is Long Polling ? <br>
Long Polling is a web development pattern that is used to surpass pushing data from the server to the client. By using Long Polling pattern, the Client requests information from the server. If the server does not have any information about the client, the server holds the request and waits for some information to be available rather than sending an empty resource.


What is CORS ? <br>
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a process used to gain the authority of different web resources on different domains. With the help of CORS, the integration of web scripts can be implemented more freely with the external content of the original domain.

What is Multi Threading ? <br>
The process of improving the performance of the CPU is known as Multi-Threading. Usually, it is seen as the ability of a program to be managed by multiple users at a single time.

What is React JS ?<br>
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. 

What is Component ?
Component is a piece of reusable code which you can be reused at any point and it's an individual piece of code which has it's own inputs and it's own outputs and it has it's own functionaliy.

What is React Hooks ? <br>
Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
